<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a free spirited adventurer by heart. My happy place is on my surfboard at backline or high up a mountain. Coffee, my dog, music, good food, good friends... That is a perfect day.<br/> I enjoy new challenges and have never stopped learning new skills. My most recent challenge has been entering the world of code. I absolutely love it and find every project all consuming.<br />I really do give my best to every person and project I commit to. This is a standard I take pride in.</p>
